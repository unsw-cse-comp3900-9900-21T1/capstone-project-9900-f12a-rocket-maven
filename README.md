# Rocket Maven

## Front End Prerequisites

### Global Environment

`Node.js`  v14.16.0 (lts)

`npm` v6.14.11 - I think this is the default version on ubuntu. I don't think versioning of this makes too much of a difference since it is just a package manager

### Development Tools

VSCode
- ESLint extension

### Setup

```
cd client
npm install
npm run start
```
