# Rocket Maven

## Front End Prerequisites

### Global Environment

`Node.js`  v14.16.0 (lts)

`npm` v6.14.11 - I think this is the default version on ubuntu. I don't think versioning of this makes too much of a difference since it is just a package manager

### Development Tools

VSCode
- ESLint

### Setup

```
cd client
npm install
npm run start
```

## Back End Stub Prerequisites
### Global Environment
`python3` 3.8.5 (Default in ubuntu I think)
`pip` package manager

### Necessary Package Setup (Still Wip)
Run commands:

```
sudo apt install python3-venv
pip install flask python-dotenv
```
