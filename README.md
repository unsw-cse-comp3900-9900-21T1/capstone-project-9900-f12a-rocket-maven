# Rocket Maven
ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ Investment Portfolio Management ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

## Front End Prerequisites

### Global Environment

`Node.js`  v14.16.0 (lts)

`npm` v6.14.11 - I think this is the default version on ubuntu. I don't think versioning of this makes too much of a difference since it is just a package manager

### Development Tools

VSCode
- ESLint extension

### Setup

```
cd client
npm install
npm run start
```

## Back End Prerequisites

### Global Environment

`Python 3.6+`

Global tox install (tox and its dependencies are the only global python packages required for the Rocket Maven system): `pip3 install tox`

### Setup

Run `tox -e dev` within the backend folder: this sets up a Tox python development environment at backend/.tox/ (which is isolated from your main Python installation) and launches the server.
