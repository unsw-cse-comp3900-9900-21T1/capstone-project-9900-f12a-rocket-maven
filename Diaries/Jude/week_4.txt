Week 4
Sunday
- more study/fiddling with back-end with regards to forms; Stub end-points for front-end testing and to improve my understanding of back end
- global css styling fixes (very quick)
- implemented global store in react using react hooks and react context; currently only hooked up for login state
- some jwt study
- portfolio detail stub implementation - implemented to establish/suggest some client design patterns so I don't block, as well make some progress into CRUD react routing
  - didn't get up to the edit-routing portion of asset-detail as I hoped I would in the beginning of the day
