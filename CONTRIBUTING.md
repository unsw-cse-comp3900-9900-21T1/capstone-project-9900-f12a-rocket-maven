# Contributing

As this is a simple capstone project, team members should feel free to send in pull requests, and even merge their own pull requests to the main branch if needed.

## Process

1. Ensure that code has been properly formatted to help conform to the software quality assessment criteria

2. Ensure that changes are made to a local branch that is as up-to-date to the main branch as possible (use `git rebase main` when the local branch is checked out). The branch name should follow the structure of: `{team member name}/{change summary}`

3. No commits/pull requests title structure is enforced, but it's recommended to follow the verb (present tense) + description format. e.g. "Add feature to front end". Back-end/Front-end should simply be called "back end"/"front end".

4. Push your branch to the remote Github repo

5. Start a pull request from the Github web interface

6. If a minor, non-breaking change is being committed, simply rebase and merge the pull request to the main branch without requesting for a review. Just ensure that the main branch is not worked on / committed / pushed directly.

    - If a complex back end change (i.e. restructuring the project, refactoring class names), assign Andy as the reviewer
    
    - If a complex front end change, assign Jude as the reviewer

    - Optional: Although the pull request should include details of the changes, changes can be communicated on Slack
