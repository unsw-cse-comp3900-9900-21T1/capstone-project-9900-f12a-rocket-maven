# Getting Started

Requires Python 3.6+. 

Install tox globally (tox and its dependencies are the only global python packages required for the Rocket Maven system):

`pip3 install tox`

Run `tox -e dev` within the root project folder: this sets up a Tox python development environment at .tox/ (which is isolated from your main Python installation).
